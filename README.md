# Profit Prediction for Startups

This project aims to predict the profitability of startup organizations using machine learning techniques. By analyzing factors such as research and development spending, marketing expenses, and administrative costs, the model generates predictions that assist in making informed decisions about resource allocation and strategic planning.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the profitability of startups. The model utilizes a dataset containing information about research and development spending, marketing expenses, administrative costs, and corresponding profitability metrics. 

## Steps Taken

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered a dataset containing relevant features such as research and development spending, marketing expenses, administrative costs, and profitability metrics.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Performed data cleaning and preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

3. **Feature Selection**: Identified the most significant features using techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance scores, and domain knowledge.

4. **Model Selection and Training**: Experimented with various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting techniques to identify the best-performing model.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, and accuracy.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the selected model to optimize its performance and generalization capabilities.

7. **Deployment**: Deployed the trained model using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the prediction system through a user-friendly web interface.

## Model Performance

The final model achieved a predictive accuracy of 95% on unseen data, indicating its effectiveness in forecasting the profitability of startup organizations.

## Usage

To use the deployed prediction system, simply visit [Profit Prediction App](https://profitpredictionx.streamlit.app/) and input the relevant information regarding research and development spending, marketing expenses, and administrative costs. The system will then generate a prediction of the startup's profitability based on the provided input.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training the model.
